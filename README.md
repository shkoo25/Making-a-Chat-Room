## Description

The project was to make a personalized chat room.

3 main languages used
	-Angular
	-HTML
	-CSS

Using Angular, I was able to make 4 different ajax calls.
	1. Make a text area so when you enter text into a text area, it will be exported
	   to a different part of the screen.
	2. Show different active, inactive, and busy users that are in the chatroom.
	3. Being able to add in a different user and use that username to the chatroom.
	4. Showing who is texting in the main text area and have it refreshing every second
	   to look for updates on messages.

Using HTML, I set up the infrastructure of the chat room.

Using CSS, I was able to design and make specific detail arrangements for the chat room specifications.
